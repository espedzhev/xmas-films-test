            comply with and ensure that its guests, staff and any other person
            invited to attend the Event (“Customer’s Guests”) also comply with

              by Customer’s Guests directed toward other customers or staff
              members will result in the offending Customer’s Guests being
              required to leave the cinema immediately without the Customer
              being entitled to a refund. What constitutes disruptive,
              antisocial or violent behaviour shall be determined at the sole

              confiscated by the Cineworld Duty Manager. The Customer is

              and may require any Customer's Guests who it reasonably considers
              to be intoxicated to leave the Cinema immediately.
            </li>
