But in this grand, if unforgiving, city, Willy’s modicum of cash is spent quickly, leading him down a path of hardship and servitude at a nearby laundry house. Though Willy’s prospects seem dashed, his hopes are not, even if the business of making chocolate is far tougher than it seems, and Willy’s genius is not welcomed by the candy cartel, who will stop at nothing to keep their clientele to themselves. However, thanks to his singular brand of brilliant ingenuity, some out-of-the-box (and hat!) thinking and the help of a few larger-than-life friends—particularly, a bright young orphan girl named Noodle—Willy becomes more determined than ever to use his talents and tenacity to make his dream come true. Through the enchantingly delicious, sometimes dangerous, life-affirming adventure that follows, Willy discovers that, while most people he encounters will choose greed over good, every cloud has a silver lining…all you need is pure imagination.",
